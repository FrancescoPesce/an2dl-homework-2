# General information
This folder contains the scripts and notebooks used to train the relevant submitted models. Since many models differ only slightly from the uploaded ones, they were overwritten and are not included in this folder. All notebooks contain cell outputs but output files, such as predictions, models and images, are not included due to size limit of Outlook emails. While notebooks `M1` and `M2` have been carefully analyzed, and some comments were made more precise after submitting, older submissions and failed attempts may contain imprecise comments.

# Content index
- `image_extractor.py`: a python script to save all training set images.
- `requirements.txt`: the set of pip libraries needed for local training.
- `failed attempts`: a collection of the most important failed attempts at improving upon model M1. They were run locally.
- `past submission`: a collection of the most relevant submissions to the Kaggle platfom, with the exception of the final models. Results mentioned in the report are for these notebooks, of for the final models. They were all run locally, except for Notebooks 1 and 8, which were run on Google Colab and Kaggle respectively.
- `latest models`: the notebooks used to develop models M1 and M2. M1 was trained locally, and M2 was trained on Kaggle.
